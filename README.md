# Weather_Based_Disease_Prediction

Climate change has emerged as a critical driver of infectious disease spread, altering environmental conditions that affect disease vectors, host interactions, and human exposure risks. Rising global temperatures, fluctuating humidity levels, and increased precipitation are expanding the range of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue.Additionally, extreme weather events, including floods and cyclones, create ideal conditions for waterborne and respiratory infections, leading to an increase in outbreaks.This project explores the intersection of climate variables and disease transmission using weather-based disease risk modeling. By analyzing meteorological dataâ€”including temperature, humidity, air quality, and precipitation, this project establishes probabilistic correlations between climate shifts and disease outbreaks. The study utilizes predictive analytics and machine learning models, achieving high accuracy in disease risk forecasting, with prediction accuracies exceeding 95% for most diseases. Understanding these patterns is essential for enhancing early warning systems, strengthening healthcare infrastructure, and formulating sustainable public health policies.
